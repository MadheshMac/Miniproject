# Refined Loan Approval Prediction through Market Trends and Seasonal Analytics

## About
This project presents an advanced loan approval prediction model that incorporates real-time economic data and seasonal market trends to improve accuracy and decision-making for both lenders and borrowers. By utilizing machine learning techniques, this system adapts to current economic conditions, setting a new standard in predictive analytics for loan approvals.

## Features
- High accuracy loan approval predictions using LightGBM with GridSearch hyperparameter tuning.
- Integration of real-time data on market trends, such as interest rates and inflation.
- Interactive prediction portal developed using Streamlit, accessible to both lenders and applicants.
- Error handling for robust user interaction and minimal input mistakes.
- Provides real-time, adaptable predictions that reflect both short- and long-term economic shifts.

## Requirements
* **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows 10/11 or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
* **Processor**: Minimum Intel Core i3 or higher.
* **RAM**: 8 GB recommended.
* **Storage**: 256 GB SSD or 500 GB HDD.
* **Development Tools**:
  - **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
  - **IDE**: Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook
  - **Libraries**: LightGBM, Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Trading Economics API.

## System Architecture
The system architecture diagram outlines the flow of data from collection and preprocessing through model training and prediction. The architecture integrates real-time economic data with user inputs, feeding these into the LightGBM model to predict loan approvals.
